Build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 
After you transform the data, you'll create CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. 
Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
